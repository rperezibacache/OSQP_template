## OSQP template

This template shows how to create a *c* code from the osqp solver usign python language.

The osqp [manual](https://osqp.org/docs/) has a *code generation* [section](https://osqp.org/docs/codegen/python.html) that will be used in this manual. Also, even though the [original publication](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:a7c19fe9-32f1-4500-ac76-cd388bc37c61/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=osqp_embedded.pdf&type_of_work=Conference+item) may be different than the current version of the software, consider it as a reference to follow the philosophy of the authors.

### Creating the qp problem and generate the C code
1. In `main.py`
